# discourse-404-redirect

**Redirect to particular page on 404**

If an ember page is `unknown`, redirect to the URL in theme setting `redirect_destination`.

Works only on links from within the forum, not lines from outside and not if a broken/missing page is reloaded in the browser.

Thanks to the [Grey Arrows Drone Club](https://greyarro.ws/) for funding development of this theme component.
